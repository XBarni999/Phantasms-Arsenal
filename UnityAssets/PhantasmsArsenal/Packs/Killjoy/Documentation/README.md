# HSM-290 Killjoy

An air-launched, two-stage aeroballistic missile for **Nuclear Option 0.34.1**. Killjoy combines a solid-fuel booster with an unpowered guided warhead for long-range attacks on ground and surface targets.

## Features

- **Two separate variants:** conventional HE with a contact fuse, and nuclear with a native 200 m airburst.
- **Two-stage flight:** the booster separates after burnout; the warhead continues on a guided ballistic descent.
- **Ballistic guidance:** a moderate loft followed by an angled dive. Terminal guidance prioritizes the impact point and accounts for velocity, gravity and target movement.
- **Altitude-dependent range:** launching from a higher carrier increases the configured launch range, up to **360 km at 10 km altitude**. Minimum launch range is **48 km**.
- **Animated warhead fins:** four fins unfold after separation and deflect with steering commands.
- **FS-41 Eclipse:** HE and nuclear variants are available on its central pylon (requires the Eclipse aircraft mod).
- **Carrier support:** KR-67 Ifrit carries **1** missile on a custom central heavy pylon; Alkyon AB-4 carries **2** externally; SFB-81 Darkreach carries **4** in its normal internal bays.
- **Native impact and damage:** contact checks exclude the missile's own colliders and trigger volumes, and cover movement between physics steps. The game's damage, penetration and fuse logic handles valid impacts.

At a carrier speed of 250 m/s, the configured maximum launch ranges are:

| Carrier altitude | Configured maximum |
| --- | --- |
| Sea level | 50 km |
| 8 km | 189 km |
| 10 km | 360 km |

These are fire-control range estimates. Actual reach and impact angle depend on launch conditions and game physics; a 360 km flight has not yet been measured. The KR-67 central pylon excludes the conflicting internal bays while equipped.

## Requirements and installation

Requires **BepInEx 5** and **Blueprinter 2.0.1**.

1. Download `HSM-290-Killjoy.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/XBarni999/HSM-290-Killjoy/releases/latest), or extract it from the release ZIP.
2. Put the DLL in your game's `BepInEx/plugins` directory.
3. Remove any older Killjoy/Kinzhal DLL before installing this version, then restart the game.

The DLL includes the Blueprinter bundle. Install only the DLL; a separate `.nobp` is unnecessary.

## First release: v1.1.0

This is the first public binary release. In-game testing by the author confirms target hits and working impact behavior after the collision correction. Multiplayer behavior and the full long-range envelope still need testing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release features.

## Building from source

Place this repository at `Assets/Blueprinter/Mods/Kh47M2` in a configured Blueprinter Editor project. The internal folder and asset IDs retain the Kh47M2/Kinzhal names for compatibility.

1. In Unity, select **Blueprinter > HSM-290 Killjoy > Build bundle**.
2. Build `Tools~/Runtime/Kinzhal/Kinzhal.csproj` in Release mode, adjusting game/assembly paths for your installation.
3. Run `Tools~/Package.ps1` to verify the embedded bundle and prepare the DLL and ZIP.

Original game assemblies and donor assets are required locally and are not included. **Create or update assets** regenerates content; use **Build bundle** to package the existing tuned assets.
